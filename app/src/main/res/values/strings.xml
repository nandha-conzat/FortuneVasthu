    <!-- About Vastu-->
    <string name="about_vastu_title">About Vastu</string>
    <string name="about_vastu">\t\tThe basic five elements of nature ie, Earth,Water,Fire,Air &amp; the space all belong and rule a particular direction. Building houses by implementing this principle is known as vastu shastra.\n\n
	\t\tHuman body itself is a combination of these five basic elements. If we handle this five elements effectively by living along with nature we will  be happy for ever.\n\n
There are so many tactics like \n\n\t\tAstrology,Nuemerology,Namology etc., that are implied in our life to make it happy and healthy but above all these the challenging factor is that a house built with perfect vastu shastra principles only can fulfill all our expectations.
